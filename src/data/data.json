He was honored with Ph.D. degree in Biotechnology from the most prestigious institution, the “Capital of Knowledge” Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, UP, India in the year 2015. His research interests are in neurodegenerative diseases-in particular Alzheimer’s disease. He has more than 10 years of experience in Neuroscience Research, specially in Alzheimer's disease. He has used animal models system to investigate the therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease using synthetic as well as natural compounds in Drosophila as a model system. He has worked as Postdoctoral Scholar at Neurobiology Department, The University of Chicago, USA. He is currently working as Research Associate at Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), SGPGI Campus, Lucknow, U.P, India.",
                
                "Dr. Singh has published his research work in journals of international repute such as, (Neurotherapeutics, Neurotoxicity Research, Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity, BBRC, Neurochemical Research, Neuroscience Letter, and Current Drug Metabolism etc.). He has been also credited with 2 book chapters. He is also the member of editorial boards of several international journals related to field of neuroscience. He is also the member of several scientific societies viz. Indian Academy of Neurosciences, Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India, American Academy of Neurology, International Society of Neurochemistry, American, and Society of Neurochemistry. Dr. Singh has been also appointed as Bentham Ambassador by Bentham Science Publisher (USA). He has attended several scientific national and international conferences/symposium/workshops in India and abroad and presented his research work. As a resource person, he has delivered lectures and seminars in various schools and colleges across the country.",

                "Dr. Singh is always concerned about the current scenario of the science education in various rural parts of India. He thinks about many societal issues, such as, science education, health, environment and agricultural issues. He always wanted to do something for the betterment of the society specially by implementing science and technology. He found himself more positive and strong for doing something for society after his USA trip. In USA, he observed that the educated and working people used to organize several charitable programme selflessly for needy people in their society. He realized that it’s our moral responsibility and duty to do something for our society if one is eligible in doing this. Then after, he determined that he would serve his great effort towards the betterment of science education, technology, modern health and agricultural issues in our country. For smooth flow of his determination, he registered the Non-profit/Non-Government Organization, Indian Scientific Education & Technology Foundation (ISET) in Dec 2016 along with his colleague Mr. Shailendra Mishra. This NGO has been working for promotion of science and technology at all possibilities of performance.",

                "The mission of ISET Foundation is to improve the quality of science education in India and to ensure that along with theoretical part, children also get equal opportunity to perform scientific practical work in schools. It will be accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Organization’s aim is to supplement in science education along with governmental efforts. It is sure, that the foundation will help in achieving the advancement in science education through facilitating the excellent scientific education, various awareness programmes, promoting the innovative ideas, and by endorsing entrepreneurship, to develop competitiveness and stewardship towards science."
